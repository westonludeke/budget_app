# Budget App

Budget App is a personal budget tracker tool designed to help users track and monitor their credit card transactions over time. Users can upload a list of transactions in CSV format to the website, categorize the transactions, and track their expenses over time.

## Overview

Budget App is built using the following technologies:

- **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime for building server-side applications.
- **Express**: Web server framework for Node.js.
- **MongoDB**: NoSQL database for storing transaction data.
- **Mongoose**: ORM for MongoDB.
- **Multer**: Middleware for handling multipart/form-data, used for file uploads.
- **Body-Parser**: Middleware for parsing incoming request bodies.
- **EJS**: Embedded JavaScript templating for rendering dynamic HTML.
- **Bootstrap**: Front-end component library for responsive design.

The project structure is organized as follows:

- `models/`: Contains Mongoose models for User and Transaction.
- `routes/`: Defines route handlers for authentication, transaction management, file upload, and reporting.
- `public/`: Contains static assets such as CSS, JavaScript, and images.
- `views/`: EJS templates for rendering HTML views.
- `services/`: Contains service logic for interacting with large language models and generating reports.
- `uploads/`: Directory for storing uploaded CSV files.
- `server.js`: Main server file that sets up the Express app and connects to MongoDB.

## Features

- **User Authentication**: Session-based authentication using username and password.
- **Transaction Upload**: Users can upload CSV files containing transaction data.
- **Transaction Management**: View, edit, and delete transactions. Add `Close Date` and `Category` to each transaction.
- **Expense Tracking**: Transactions are grouped by `Close Date`, with summaries of the number of transactions and total amounts.
- **Reporting**: Generate reports of expenses by category and month. Filter reports by `Close Date`.
- **Save Changes**: Save button to persist updates to the database.
