# Budget App

Budget App is a personal budget tracker tool designed to track and monitor credit card transactions over time. Users can upload a list of transactions in CSV format to the website, categorize them, and track expenses over time.

## Overview

### Architecture and Technologies

The Budget App is built using the following technologies:
- **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime for building the server-side of the application.
- **Express**: Web server framework for Node.js.
- **MongoDB**: NoSQL database for storing user and transaction data.
- **Mongoose**: ORM for MongoDB, used to define data models.
- **Multer**: Middleware for handling file uploads.
- **Body-Parser**: Middleware for parsing request bodies.
- **EJS**: Templating engine for rendering HTML views.
- **Bootstrap**: Front-end library for responsive design.

### Project Structure

The project is organized into the following key directories and files:
- `models/`: Contains Mongoose schemas for `User` and `Transaction`.
- `routes/`: Defines the application's routes, including authentication, upload, and transaction management.
- `public/`: Contains static files such as CSS, JavaScript, and uploaded CSV files.
- `views/`: Contains EJS templates for rendering HTML views.
- `services/`: Contains service files for interacting with external APIs.
- `server.js`: Main server file that sets up the Express server and connects to MongoDB.
- `.env`: Configuration file for environment variables (not included in version control).
- `.env.example`: Template for setting up environment variables.
- `.gitignore`: Specifies files and directories to be ignored by Git.

## Features

The Budget App offers the following core features:
- **User Authentication**: Session-based authentication using username and password.
- **Transaction Upload**: Users can upload CSV files containing transactions.
- **Transaction Management**: Users can view, edit, and delete transactions.
- **Transaction Categorization**: Users can add categories and close dates to transactions.
- **Expense Tracking**: Transactions are grouped by close date, and users can track the number and total amount of transactions.
- **Reporting**: The app provides reports of expenses by category, grouped by each month.
